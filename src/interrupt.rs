/// on its enum of available external interrupts for a specific device.
/// Each variant must convert to a u16 of its interrupt number,
/// which is its exception number - 16.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This trait must only be implemented on enums of device interrupts. Each
/// enum variant must represent a distinct value (no duplicates are permitted),
/// and must always return the same value (do not change at runtime).
///
/// These requirements ensure safe nesting of critical sections.
